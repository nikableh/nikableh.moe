# Things I want to learn (more) about

::callout-note
This is a list of topics, technologies or just _things_ I want to learn more
about.

I doesn't necessarily mean I don't know _anything_ about said
thing, but it does imply I want to deepen my understanding about the topic.

This is a living document and it will be updated from time to time.
::

- NUMA
- The boot process of a PC _(from pressing the power button to starting PID 1)_
- eBPF
- DPDK _(at least write a "Hello, World" in it)_
- Memory mapping and `mmap()`
- Zombie processes

Weird, it feels like there were a lot more things that I can't remember right
now...
